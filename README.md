# Single Image Super Resolution

This repository contains some SISR experiments originally derived from [SRGAN](https://github.com/leftthomas/SRGAN). It includes ideas from [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802), [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02921), and [ESRGAN: Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219). Weights are not included. 

# Dataset

The naming of the paths in the code of this repository imply that it uses [VOC2012](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/~mooyeol/pascal_voc_2012/), but in fact has been setup to use [DIV2K](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/).
